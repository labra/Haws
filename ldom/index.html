				LDOM (Linked Data Object Model) is an RDF-based modeling language that is compatible with
				Linked Data principles and leverages some object-oriented concepts to the Web.
				LDOM makes it possible to define classes together with their associated properties,
				and to specify additional constraints that valid members of those classes should fulfill.
				These additional constraints are expressed using SPARQL, yet the structural definitions of
				associated properties can also be used by tools without a SPARQL processor.
				In addition to a vocabulary for structural constraints, LDOM includes modularization features
				that make it possible to define new modeling terms (SPARQL functions and templates) based
				on executable semantics.
			</p>
			<p>
				LDOM has a wide range of potential use cases.  Its alignment with object-oriented principles
				means that LDOM can be used to store and share data objects that represent the
				"model" in applications built with a Model-View-Control architecture.
				In contrast to most object-oriented systems, RDF adds the value of having a unique identification
				mechanism for objects (via their URIs), thus also allowing data models to reference
				each other across the web.
				Through its foundation on Linked Data principles, LDOM data models are self-describing,
				which means that applications can dynamically learn about the behavior of objects by
				resolving URIs.
				Finally, the structural definitions of classes and properties can be exploited
				by user interface builders to select suitable display and input widgets.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document introduces LDOM to people familiar with basic concepts of RDF and SPARQL.
				A simple model about rectangles and squares is used to introduce all major features of LDOM,
				including class definitions, constraints, rules, functions and templates.
				This document can serve as the "Hello, World" example of LDOM.
				This primer is a possible companion to another document (to be written) that serves as a language
				reference and full specification.

      		<h2>Introduction</h2>
      		<p>
      			LDOM (Linked Data Object Model) is a modeling language for linked data, based
      			on a minimum sub-set of RDF Schema and object-oriented principles.
      			Features of LDOM include:
      		</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>
	      			An RDF vocabulary to define <a href="#classes">classes</a> together with structural
	      			declarations of	the <a href="#properties">properties</a> associated with those classes.
      			</li>
      			<li>
      				<a href="#constraints">Complex constraints</a> can be expressed in SPARQL and
      				associated with classes	to validate instances of those classes.
      			</li>
      			<li>
	      			<a href="#rules">Rules</a> can be used to construct new values from existing values.
      			</li>
      			<li>
	      			Built-in <a href="#templates">extension mechanisms</a>, allowing users to define new high-level
	      			template languages as well as falling back to SPARQL when needed.
      			</li>
      			<li>
	      			An RDF vocabulary to define new <a href="#functions">SPARQL functions</a> that can be used in
	      			any SPARQL query.
      			</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>
      			LDOM is based on RDF and is compatible with Linked Data principles, making it possible to
      			mix LDOM declarations with models created in other semantic web languages.
      			Other sections elaborate on the relationships of LDOM with
      			<a href="#rdf-schema">RDF Schema</a> and <a href="#owl">OWL</a>.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      			This document uses a running example model illustrated in the following UML diagram.
      			In a nut shell, there is a class Rectangle which has a subclass Square, both in the
      			example namespace "ex".
      			All Rectangles can have a width and a height, both integers greater than 0.
      			The area of a Rectangle gets computed by multiplying width and height.
      			Squares must have equal width and height.
      			Rectangles can have one creator, which must be an instance of the class schema:Person. 
      		</p>
      		<p>
      			LDOM definitions are represented in RDF and can be serialized in multiple RDF formats.
      			The example snippets in this document use Turtle [[turtle]] notation.
      			<span class="todo">
      			TODO: Future versions should have this switchable between Turtle and JDON-LD [[json-ld]].
      			</span>
      			You should be familiar with basic RDF concepts [[rdf11-concepts]] such as triples and
      			(for the advanced concepts of LDOM) with SPARQL [[sparql11-overview]].

      		</p>
      		<p>
      			The LDOM system vocabulary is defined in itself, using its own

    		<h2>Class Declarations</h2>
    		<p>
    			Basic class definitions are covered by a subset of RDF Schema
    			(see <a href="#rdf-schema">relationship with RDF Schema</a>),
    			as illustrated in the following example source code:
    		</p>
    		<pre class="example">
ex:Rectangle
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource ;
	rdfs:label "Rectangle" .

ex:Square
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf ex:Rectangle ;
	rdfs:label "Square" .</pre>
			<p>
				The type <code>rdfs:Class</code> (or its subclasses such as <code>owl:Class</code>)
				are used to declare a class.  <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> is used to indicate that
				all instances of a subclass are also instances of its superclass(es).
				The commonly used properties <code>rdfs:label</code> and <code>rdfs:comment</code>
				are recommended to declare human-readable labels and documentation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reuse of the standard RDF Schema terms means that LDOM models can be readily
				mixed with existing Linked Data models.
			</p>
			<p>
				LDOM introduces a property <code>ldom:abstract</code> that can be set to <code>true</code>
				for classes that should not be directly instantiated.
				Furthermore, classes may be marked <code>ldom:private</code> to indicate that they
				are only meant to be used inside of the graph that they have been defined in.
				This can be used to discourage instantiation outside of controlled scenarios.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that in contrast to many object-oriented languages, RDF Schema classes may have
				multiple superclasses.
				The root class in RDF Schema is <code>rdfs:Resource</code>, and top-level classes
				in an LDOM model must state explicitly that they are <code>rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource</code>.
				In other words, each valid LDOM class needs to have at least one named superclass.
			</p>

			<h2>Property Declarations</h2>
    		<p>
    			Object-oriented systems have a concept of properties (or fields) that hold
    			attributes and relationships of a given class.
    			The following sections explain how such property attachments can be represented in LDOM.
    		</p>
    		<section id="basic-properties">
    			<h3>Basic Property Characteristics</h3>
	    		<p>
	    			It is common (in UML etc) to specify the name of a property and its
	    			cardinality (min/max value count) as well as the value type.
	    			In LDOM, these declarations can be attached to a class as follows:
	    		</p>
	    		<pre class="example">
ex:Rectangle
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource ;
	rdfs:label "Rectangle" ;
	ldom:property [
		a ldom:PropertyConstraint ;     # This type declaration is optional
		ldom:predicate ex:height ;
		ldom:minCount 1 ;
		ldom:maxCount 1 ;
		ldom:valueType xsd:integer ;
		rdfs:label "height" ;
		rdfs:comment "The height of the Rectangle." ;
	] ;
	ldom:property [
		ldom:predicate ex:width ;
		ldom:minCount 1 ;
		ldom:maxCount 1 ;
		ldom:valueType xsd:integer ;
		rdfs:label "width" ;
		rdfs:comment "The width of the Rectangle." ;
	] ;
	ldom:property [
		ldom:predicate ex:creator ;
		ldom:maxCount 1 ;
		ldom:valueType schema:Person ;
		rdfs:label "creator" ;
		rdfs:comment "The creator of the Rectangle." ;
	] ;</pre>
				<p>
					The examples in this document are (currently) all written in Turtle, but here is a snippet
					previewing how the JSON-LD could look like:
				</p>
				<pre class="example">
{
	"@context" : [
	    "http://www.w3.org/ns/ldom/context.jsonld",
	    {
	    	"ex" : "http://example.com/ns#"
	    }
	],
	
	"@graph" : [
	    {
	    	"@id" : "http://example.com/ns",
	    	"@type" : "Graph",
	    	"library" : "http://www.w3.org/ns/ldom/core",
	    	"label" : "Test Graph",
	    	"comment" : "This is a comment."
	    },
	    {
	    	"@id" : "ex:Rectangle",
	    	"@type" : "Class",
	    	"subClassOf" : "rdfs:Resource",
	    	"label" : "Rectangle",
	    	"property" : [
	    	    {
	    	    	"predicate" : "ex:width",
	    	    	"minCount" : 1,
	    	    	"maxCount" : 1,
	    	    	"valueType" : "xsd:integer",
	    	    	"label" : "width",
	    	    	"comment" : "The width of the Rectangle."
	    	    },
	    	    ...
	    	]
	    }
	]
}</pre>
				<p>
					Tools that understand LDOM can use the information above for many purposes.
					For example, they can figure out which fields should appear for an input form,
					and what values those fields can have, as well as labels and comments.
					Furthermore, they can verify that a given instance of Rectangle has the
					expected value types and cardinalities for its properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					The system property <code>ldom:property</code> is used to link a class with its
					property declarations.  Properties get inherited by subclasses.
					The values of this property are nodes with the following properties:

    			<h3>Datatype Property Characteristics</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to those basic property characteristics, it is possible to use others

					The following example illustrates how a valid instance of the rectangle class
					can look like.  By virtue of the <code>rdf:type</code> triple (abbreviated as
					<code>a</code> in Turtle), a user interface	tool could select appropriate input
					widgets or validate the instance.
				</p>
				<pre class="example">

			</section>
			<section id="inverse-properties">
				<h3>Inverse Property Declarations</h3>
				<p>
					Due to the triple-based data model of RDF, it is possible to "walk" a relationship
					in both directions - from subject to object and from object to subject.
					LDOM can be used to declare that a property is associated with a class, even
					if the predicate is actually used in the inverse direction.
					As shown below, the system property <code>ldom:inverseProperty</code> is used
					in such cases, and very similar characteristics as previously mentioned can
					be applied in these inverse property declarations.
				</p>
				<pre class="example">
schema:Person
	ldom:inverseProperty [
		ldom:predicate ex:creator ;
		ldom:valueType ex:Rectangle ;
		rdfs:label "created rectangle" ;
		rdfs:comment "Links a Person with all rectangles that he or she created." ;
	] ...</pre>
				<p>
					The above instructs a user interface builder that persons can have a property
					labeled "created rectangle" and defines a suitable value type.
					Not shown in the example are <code>ldom:minCount</code> and <code>ldom:maxCount</code>,
					because there may be 0 to infinitely many values in this direction. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Declaring an inverse property is semantically equivalent to having a normal
					property starting in the related class.  From the perspective of the full
					data model, declaring an inverse property is therefore redundant.
					However, having an inverse property is often useful to provide a more complete
					picture in the context of a single resource or class.
					Furthermore it becomes possible to define more suitable human-readable labels
					and comments for the inverse direction.

    		<h2>Constraints</h2>
    		<p>
    			The property declarations shown in the previous chapter define conditions that
    			all valid instances of a class need to fulfill.
    			They do this in a declarative language with a limited number of properties
    			such as <code>ldom:maxCount</code>.

    		<section id="sparql-constraints">
				<h3>SPARQL-based Constraints</h3>
	    		<p>
					For example, the width and height of a Square must be equal.
					These constraints can be attached to class definitions using <code>ldom:constraint</code>
					as shown in the next example:
	    		</p>
	    		<pre class="example">
ex:Square
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Square" ;
	rdfs:subClassOf ex:Rectangle ;

		ldom:path ex:width ;
		ldom:path ex:height ;
		ldom:sparql """
			ASK {
				?this ex:width ?width .
				?this ex:height ?height .
				FILTER (?width != ?height) .
			}
			""" ;
	] ;
.</pre>
				<p class="todo">
					Open issue: Many people find it confusing that the expression seems to work
					"backwards" and only find the counter-examples.  So the term "constraint"
					might be misleading.  An alternative name "exception" has been proposed
					(although this term has a different meaning in programming languages).
					Furthermore, many values of ldom:constraint are in fact template calls,
					and the user doesn't even see the SPARQL query (e.g. ldon:minCount uses
					a positive direction even if its internal SPARQL query checks for counter-examples).
				</p>
				<p>
					The example above uses SPARQL to implement an executable test.
					The SPARQL query must return <code>true</code> if the condition is violated, using the variable
					<code>?this</code> to refer to the currently tested instance.
					The property <code>ldom:constraint</code> is linking a class with the additional
					constraints that it needs to fulfill.
					Each of the values of <code>ldom:constraint</code> can have a <code>ldom:sparql</code>
					query (ASK, SELECT or CONSTRUCT), or they can be instances of Templates as shown
					<a href="#template-constraints">later</a>.
					In SPARQL-based constraints, the properties <code>ldom:message</code>, <code>ldom:path</code>
					and	<code>ldom:level</code> (with values <code>ldom:Error</code>,
					<code>ldom:Warning</code> and <code>ldom:FatalError</code>) can be used to provide
					additional information on the constraint violation.
				</p>
				<p>
					As alternatives to ASK, you can use SPARQL SELECT or CONSTRUCT queries to take more
					control over which constraint violations to create.
					While a little bit more verbose, one advantage of those syntaxes is greater flexibility
					in how to build error messages etc. 
					The following example implements the same error condition as shown above, but using
					a CONSTRUCT query.  An example of SELECT-based constraints can be found
					<a href="#global-constraints">below</a>.

				<h3>Template-based Constraints</h3>
				<p class="todo">
					TODO: This section needs work - templates are used but not introduced yet at this stage.
					The problem is that we want non-SPARQL experts to still be able to use those templates
					even if they don't understand how they work internally.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to constraints defined in SPARQL, LDOM makes it possible to define constraints
					using higher-level elements called Templates.
					(How to define your own Templates is introduced <a href="#templates">later</a>.)
					The following example demonstrates the use of the Template <code>ldom:ShapeConstraint</code>
					which links a property with a "shape" that it needs to fulfill:
				</p>
			<pre class="example">
ex:Rectangle
	ldom:constraint [
		a ldom:ShapeConstraint ;
		ldom:predicate ex:creator ;
		ldom:some [
			ldom:property [
				ldom:predicate schema:email ;
				ldom:minCount 1 ;
			] ;
		] ;
	] ;</pre>
				<p>
					The above means that at least one of the values of the property <code>ex:creator</code>
					must be an object that has at least one <code>schema:email</code> value.
					This constraint gets evaluated together with the constraints defined by the property
					declarations, which means that the <code>ex:creator</code> must also be an instance
					of <code>schema:Person</code>.
					The property <code>ldom:some</code> means "at least one" - use <code>ldom:all</code>
					to specify that <em>all</em> values of the property must match the given shape.
					Note that the matching values do not have to be instances of the given shape,
					i.e. no <code>rdf:type</code> triple is required.
					Shapes can be nested, e.g. using additional <code>ldom:constraint</code> values.
				</p>
				<p>
					Templates can also be used as values of <code>ldom:property</code>, as long as
					the template is a subclass of the system template <code>ldom:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					The LDOM core includes two such templates:
					<a href="#derived-properties"><code>ldom:DerivedPropertyConstraint</code></a>
					and <code>ldom:PrimaryKeyProperty</code>.
					Here is an example of the latter, declaring that the values of the property
					<code>ex:isoCode</code> must be unique for each instance of <code>ex:Country</code>.
				</p>
				<pre class="example">
ex:Country
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource ;
	rdfs:label "Country" ;
  	ldom:property [
  		a ldom:PrimaryKeyPropertyConstraint ;
		ldom:predicate ex:isoCode ;
		ldom:valueType xsd:string ;
		ldom:uriStart "http://example.org/country-" ;
		rdfs:label "ISO code" ;
    ] ...</pre>
    			<p>
					This type of constraint also specifies how the URIs of instances need to
					be constructed, by concatenating the provided <code>ldom:uriStart</code>
					with the value of the primary key.
					Tools can use this information to automatically create URIs for newly
					created instances, and for data imported from external non-RDF sources
					such as relational databases. 
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Another built-in template is <code>ldom:OrConstraint</code> which can be
    				used to combine multiple other constraint templates to express that at least one
    				of two conditions need to be satisfied.
    				The following example expresses that a <code>ex:RectangleWithArea</code> must either
    				have <code>ex:width</code> and <code>ex:height</code>, or a value for
    				<code>ex:area</code>:
    			</p>
    			<pre class="example">
ex:RectangleWithArea
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf ex:Rectangle ;
	ldom:constraint [
		a ldom:OrConstraint ;
		ldom:shape1 [
			ldom:property [
				ldom:predicate ex:width ;
				ldom:minCount 1 ;
			] ;
			ldom:property [

		] ;
		ldom:shape2 [
			ldom:property [
				ldom:predicate ex:area ;
				ldom:minCount 1 ;
			]
		]
	] ;
.</pre>
				<p>
					The SPARQL query behind the <code>ldom:OrConstraint</code> uses a built-in
					helper function <code>ldom:hasShape</code> to recursively evaluate
					the nested shapes.  Based on this function, similar templates (such as exclusive-or)
					could be defined. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Many other kinds of templates can be used from third-party template libraries
					that provide high-level vocabularies for common design patterns.

				<h3>Global Constraints</h3>
				<p>
					So far all constraint examples had been attached to classes, in an object-oriented
					style.  This has the benefit of a natural way of organizing constraints, and makes
					it easier for an engine to determine which constraints are relevant for a given
					resource only.  The variable <code>?this</code> is used in those to refer to the
					currently evaluated instance.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some cases, it is necessary to define constraints that do not have a local
					object scope, but rather apply globally.
					These can be expressed by instantiating <code>ldom:GlobalConstraint</code>,
					as shown in the following example.
				</p>
				<pre class="example">
ex:MyConstraint
	a ldom:GlobalConstraint ;
	ldom:message "Deprecated properties should not be used anywhere." ;
	ldom:level ldom:Warning ;
	ldom:sparql """
			SELECT ?root ?predicate ?value
			WHERE {
				?root ?predicate ?value .
				?predicate owl:deprecated ?any .
			}
		""" ;
.</pre>
				<p>
					By default, these constraints are assumed to have a SPARQL query, but
					it is also possible to instantiate templates.
					Global constraints should be named with a URI (in this example: <code>ex:MyConstraint</code>)
					so that they are easier to reference and manage.

    		<h2>Templates</h2>
    		<p>
    			LDOM Templates are "boxed" queries that can be used as values of
    			<code>ldom:constraint</code> and <code>ldom:property</code>
    			(as well as <code>ldom:rule</code> if that gets included into the standard).
    			The role of a template is to encapsulate a reusable piece of SPARQL logic
    			so that users do not need to reinvent the wheel.
    			Templates hide the complexity of the underlying SPARQL query and are therefore
    			suitable for people who are not familiar with SPARQL.
    			The following example declares a LDOM template that can be used for
    			constraints to express that the values of a given property shall be
    			greater than 0. 
    		</p>
    		<pre class="example">

			FILTER (?value &lt;= 0) .
			BIND (CONCAT("Property ", ldom:label(?property), 
				" must only have positive values, but found ",
				xsd:string(?value)) AS ?message) .
		}
		""" ;
.</pre>
  			<p>
  				In the example above, the template takes an argument, as specified by the
  				<code>ldom:argument</code>.  This argument is represented by a value of
  				the property <code>ex:property</code> which is mapped to the variable
  				<code>?property</code> when the query executes.
  				Here is an example that instantiates, or "calls", the template to
  				define constraints on the properties ex:width and ex:height for all instances
  				of the class ex:Rectangle.
  			</p>
  			<pre class="example">
ex:Rectangle
	...

		ex:property ex:width ;
	] .</pre>
    		<p>
    			When a LDOM engine encounters such a constraint definition, it will
    			execute the <code>ldom:sparql</code> body of the template and pre-bind the declared
    			argument variables with the values specified in the template call.
    			In the case of <code>ex:height</code>, the template's body basically becomes the following,
    			where every appearance of the variable <code>?property</code> has been replaced with
    			the constant ex:height.
    		</p>
    		<pre class="example">
SELECT (ex:height AS ?path) ?message
WHERE {
	?this ex:height ?value .
	FILTER (?value &lt;= 0) .
	BIND (CONCAT("Property ", ldom:label(ex:height), 
		" must only have positive values, but found ", xsd:string(?value)) AS ?message) .
}</pre>
			<p>
				LDOM templates make it possible to create libraries of reusable constraints
				and rules (and other use cases), so that users do not need to learn SPARQL.
				The LDOM standard comes with several of such reusable constraints including
				<code>ldom:PropertyConstraint</code> and <code>ldom:Argument</code>
				which is used by LDOM itself to declare the arguments of templates.
			</p>
			<p>
				The example above highlights that LDOM templates can be used to create higher-level
				modeling languages that introduce constructs such as the
				<code>ex:PositivePropertyValueConstraint</code> above together
				with semantics that are executable by any LDOM-compliant engine.
				At the same time, high-level elements such as the property declarations can also be used by
				other engines that do not necessarily rely on SPARQL.

    			The following snippet defines a function <code>ex:computeArea</code> that takes
    			a Rectangle as its argument and returns an integer that is the result of

  			<p>
  				LDOM functions have a SELECT query as their body, and this query needs to have one
  				result variable (here: <code>?result</code>).  The first binding of this variable will be used
  				as result of the function execution.  The execution mechanism is illustrated in the
  				following diagram.
  			</p>
      		<img style="margin-left: 23px" src="images/computeArea-function.png"></img>
  			<!-- p>
  				Since LDOM is based on Semantic Web standards, the principles of Linked Data apply.
  				For example, SPARQL engines can look up the definition of a new function that it has
  				not encountered before by following the URI of the function (here: ex:computeArea).
  				Likewise, when a LDOM constraint engine encounters a resource, it can follow the
  				declared <b>rdf:type</b> triples of that resource to look up the definition of the
  				class on the internet, on a company-wide local network or by using a custom URI resolution mechanism.
  				The definition of the class may involve ldom:property and ldom:constraint triples
  				that help the LDOM engine make sense of objects in an entirely declarative manner.
  				As a result of this, LDOM helps to turn Linked Data into <b>Linked Data Objects</b>
  				&#x2014; self-describing resources that support an extensible and dynamic system architecture.
  				Such an architecture only requires the hard-coding of a few generic software components,
  				while much of the runtime behavior is controlled and discovered dynamically.
  				LDOM can also be used in conjunction with other Semantic Web languages like OWL
  				and to extend existing ontologies with the rich expressivity of SPARQL.

    			In those rules, the variable <code>?this</code> refers to each instance of those classes.

    			LDOM constraints can be grouped into contexts - URIs that have the type

				apply by default, but only for certain applications or user communities.
				The property <code>ldom:context</code> links an <code>ldom:Constraint</code>
				with a context:
    		</p>
    		<pre class="example">

				In the example above, the class <code>ex:Rectangle</code> has been extended
				with a minimum cardinality constraint on the property <code>dct:publisher</code>.
				This constraint is applicable in the provided <code>ldom:context</code> only,
				which means that it does not apply by default.
				However, certain applications that process <code>ex:Rectangle</code> instances
				can trigger the constraint checking in a context that includes all default
				constraints plus the extra constraints from the <code>http://example.org/trackable</code>
				context.
			</p>
			<p>
				The operation that triggers the constraint checking can take included and excluded
				contexts as argument.  Contexts can be organized into hierarchies using
				<code>ldom:subContextOf</code>, which means that whenever a super-context is requested
				then all constraints from its sub-contexts also apply.
				The built-in URI <code>ldom:DefaultContext</code> can be used to specify the default

    		<h2>Graph Management</h2>
    		<p>
    			LDOM models are typically organized in RDF graphs (e.g. stored as files or
    			named graphs on a database).
    			These graphs usually have a URI that helps a system resolve the graph when
    			it is requested.
    			Each LDOM graph may declare an instance of <code>ldom:Graph</code>
    			that has the graph URI as its URI and contains information about the graph itself,
    			including a human-readable label and comments. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			For constraint checking and rule execution, LDOM definitions often need to reference
    			other graphs that either contain additional classes, properties and instances,
    			or that may declare templates, rules and constraints that are needed at run-time.
    			LDOM graphs may reference each other via two dedicated properties:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>
    				<code>ldom:include</code> links a graph with other graphs that shall be included
    				into the query graph over which LDOM constraints and rules are executed.
    				This is a transitive property, i.e. includes of includes are also added.
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<code>ldom:library</code> links a graph with other (library) graphs that shall be
    				included into the control graph that includes template definitions as well as the LDOM
    				metamodel itself.
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
    			The separation between the graph closures via <code>ldom:include</code> and
    			<code>ldom:library</code> allows LDOM users and implementations to optimize performance
				because they can exclude certain (library) graphs from the union graph that is used
				by the SPARQL engine.
				Furthermore, editing and display tools may chose to hide library graphs as they often
				contain rather low-level information that is not of interest to average users.

    			It is a well-established practice in software development to define test cases that

	    			RDF Schema [[rdf-schema]] models: <code>rdfs:Resource</code>, <code>rdfs:Class</code>,
	    			<code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, <code>rdf:type</code>, <code>rdf:Property</code> and
	    			<code>rdfs:Literal</code> (and the built-in datatypes).
	    			LDOM relies on class inheritance via <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> to figure out which
	    			constraints	to fire, and which properties to inherit, and on <code>rdf:type</code> to link
	    			instances with their class definitions.
	    			RDF's concept of Linked Data applies to LDOM too, e.g. LDOM engines could look up the
	    			definitions of templates and functions by resolving	their URIs.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			LDOM does not give any special meaning to all other RDF Schema terms including
	    			<code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>, <code>rdfs:range</code> and <code>rdfs:domain</code>,
	    			which means that these are ignored by the standard LDOM semantics.
	    			However, it would be possible to define LDOM constraints that interpret 
	    			selected RDFS vocabulary with closed-world semantics, if that is desirable within
	    			certain contexts.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			In LDOM it is theoretically not necessary to define rdf:Properties as stand-alone
	    			entities - their declaration is optional because all relevant information about
	    			the property can be regarded as local to the associated classes only.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Overall, it is perfectly fine to mix existing RDF Schemas with LDOM declarations,
	    			either in the same graph or in multiple graphs that reference each other.
	    			This way, hybrid models can be created that are interpreted with the traditional
	    			open-world semantics of RDF Schema in some scenarios, or the closed-world semantics
	    			of LDOM in other use cases.
	    			The bulk of instance data can be reused between both worlds.

	    		<h3>OWL</h3>
	    		<p>
	    			The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/OWL">Web Ontology Language (OWL)</a>
	    			extends RDF Schema and its original open-world design with a focus on classification
	    			problems.  The attachment of restrictions to classes is very similar to LDOM.
	    			Designing complex class definitions by combining restrictions and other class
	    			constructors resembles the concept of nested shapes in ShEx
	    			(and ldom:all and ldom:some).
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Like with RDF Schema, it is possible to build OWL ontologies that also include LDOM
	    			constructs as an additional feature.  This also means that the basic structure of
	    			most OWL ontologies and their instances can be reused from a LDOM perspective.
	    			There are also several implementations of a subset of OWL with closed-world semantics
	    			in SPIN, which can be converted to LDOM.
	    			LDOM's foundation on SPARQL means that OWL models can be enriched with frequently
	    			needed features such as string and mathematical operations, and complex conditions
	    			that require variables. 
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Here is a rough comparison between LDOM elements and their OWL equivalents,
	    			assuming a closed-world interpretation of OWL.

	    		<p>
	    			The discussions in the Shapes WG led to refinements of the constraint violation
	    			syntax that also exist in <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/RDFUnit.html">RDFUnit</a>.
	    			Also, RDFUnit has a notion of TestCases which inspired the design of the
	    			<code>ldom:TestCase</code> class. Furthermore, the concept of <code>ldom:Context</code>
	    			borrows ideas from the RDFUnit properties appliesTo and source.
